<h1 class="title">Deploying an Application on the Symbian platform<br /><span class="subtitle"></span>
</h1>
<p>Applications are deployed to Symbian devices in signed <tt>.sis</tt> package files. The <tt>.sis</tt> file content is controlled with <tt>.pkg</tt> files. The <tt>.pkg</tt> file contains a set of instructions used by tools to produce a <tt>.sis</tt> file. <tt>qmake</tt> generates a default <tt>.pkg</tt> file for your project. The <tt>.pkg</tt> file generated by <tt>qmake</tt> is typically fully functional for testing purposes but when planning to deliver your application to end-users some changes are needed. This document describes what changes are typically needed and how to implement them.</p>
<a name="static-linking"></a>
<h2>Static Linking</h2>
<p>Qt for the Symbian platform does currently not support static linking of Qt libraries.</p>
<a name="shared-libraries"></a>
<h2>Shared Libraries</h2>
<p>When deploying the application using the shared libraries approach we must ensure that the Qt runtime is correctly redistributed along with the application executable, and also that all Qt dependencies are redistributed along with the application.</p>
<p>We will demonstrate these procedures in terms of deploying the <a href="widgets-wiggly.html">Wiggly</a> application that is provided in Qt's examples directory.</p>
<a name="building-qt-as-a-shared-library"></a>
<h3>Building Qt as a Shared Library</h3>
<p>We assume that you already have installed Qt as a shared library, in the <tt>C:\path\to\Qt</tt> directory which is the default when installing Qt for Symbian. For more information on how to build Qt, see the <a href="installation.html">Installation</a> documentation.</p>
<a name="shared-libraries"></a>
<h2>Shared Libraries</h2>
<p>After ensuring that Qt is built as a shared library, we can build the <a href="widgets-wiggly.html">Wiggly</a> application. First, we must go into the directory that contains the application:</p>
<pre> cd examples\widgets\wiggly</pre>
<p>To prepare the application for deployment we must ensure that the <tt>.pkg</tt> file generated by <tt>qmake</tt> contains the relevant vendor information and embeds the necessary dependencies to the application deployment file (<tt>.sis</tt>). The content of the generated <tt>.pkg</tt> file can be controlled with the Symbian specific <tt>qmake</tt> <a href="qmake-variable-reference.html#deployment">DEPLOYMENT</a> keyword extensions.</p>
<p>First, we will change the vendor statement to something more meaningful. The application vendor is visible to end-user during the installation.</p>
<pre> vendorinfo = \
     &quot;%{\&quot;Example Localized Vendor\&quot;}&quot; \
     &quot;:\&quot;Example Vendor\&quot;&quot;

 my_deployment.pkg_prerules = vendorinfo
 DEPLOYMENT += my_deployment</pre>
<p>Second we will tell the Symbian application installer that this application supports only S60 5.0 based devices:</p>
<pre> supported_platforms = \
     &quot;; This demo only supports S60 5.0&quot; \
     &quot;[0x1028315F],0,0,0,{\&quot;S60ProductID\&quot;}&quot;

 default_deployment.pkg_prerules -= pkg_platform_dependencies
 my_deployment.pkg_prerules += supported_platforms
 DEPLOYMENT += my_deployment</pre>
<p>You can find a list of platform and device indentification codes from <a href="http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/S60_Platform_and_device_identification_codes">Forum Nokia Wiki</a>. By default <tt>.pkg</tt> file generated by <tt>qmake</tt> adds support for all S60 3rd edition FP1, S60 3rd edition FP2 and S60 5th edition devices.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to compile the application and create the application deployment file. Run <tt>qmake</tt> to create Symbian specific makefiles, resources (.rss) and deployment packaging files (<tt>.pkg</tt>). And do build to create the application binaries and resources.</p>
<pre> qmake
 make release-gcce</pre>
<p>If everything compiled and linked without any errors, we are now ready to create an application installation package (<tt>wiggly_installer.sis</tt>).</p>
<p>If you haven't done so already, download the latest release of the Smart Installer from <a href="http://get.qt.nokia.com/nokiasmartinstaller/">http://get.qt.nokia.com/nokiasmartinstaller/</a>, and install it on top of the Qt package</p>
<p>Then use this command to create the installer sis package:</p>
<pre> make installer_sis</pre>
<p>If all binaries and dependencies were found, you should now have a self signed <tt>wiggly_installer.sis</tt> ready to be installed on a device. The smart installer contained in the in the installer package will download the necessary dependencies such as Qt libraries to the device.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you want to have your application properly Symbian Signed for distribution, you will have to properly sign both the application and the application installer packages. Please see <a href="http://developer.symbian.org/wiki/index.php/Category:Symbian_Signed">Symbian Signed wiki</a> for more information about Symbian Signed.</p>
